# Flashcard plugin for silverbullet.md


This repository is inspired by [st3v3nmw/obsidian-spaced-repetition](https://github.com/st3v3nmw/obsidian-spaced-repetition)

## Features

Create flashcards from your notes.

Currently this plugin uses [Free Spaced Repetition Scheduler (FSRS)](https://github.com/open-spaced-repetition) as spaced repetition algorithm.

Working:
- Single-line reversed style (Question::Answer)
- Multi-line style (Separated by ?)

Work in Progress:
- Decks hierarchy
- Cloze cards (==highlight== your cloze deletions!, **bolded text**, {{text in curly braces}}, or use custom cloze patterns)

## Installation

```
- github:jhanos/silverbullet-flashcard/flashcard.plug.js

to your `PLUGS` file, run `Plugs: Update` command and off you go!

## How To

2. Create multiple notes using:
  - Single-line reversed style (Question::Answer)
